// In the above code, we created a functional component called Footer. We used Tailwind CSS classes to style the footer. The footer displays the copyright information and stays at the bottom of the page using the mt-auto class. We then exported the Footer component to use it in other parts of the application.
// Now that we have created the Footer component, we can import and use it in the App component to display the footer at the bottom of the page. We can also customize the content and styling of the footer as needed.
